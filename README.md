## 1. Introduction
Due to the large size of the SkyWalking and Arthas related files (400MB), they have been moved to the `include_java` branch to facilitate easier downloads.  
If these files are not required, you can save time by cloning only the main branch:
```
bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/ZY945/docker-compose-patterns.git
```
## 2. Usage
1. Refer to the `read.md` file in the `sh` folder for startup instructions.
2. The environment variables needed for startup are located in the `docker_env` file within the `env` folder under the `sh` directory.
